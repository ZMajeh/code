        We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
        comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, money laundering, and human trafficking laws
        respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
        don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) including against children — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others; hosting or publishing any obscene content; or inciting the violation of applicable laws
        don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services — for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures. When we index the web to bring you search results, we respect standard usage restrictions that website owners specify in their websites’ code, so we require the same when others use our services
